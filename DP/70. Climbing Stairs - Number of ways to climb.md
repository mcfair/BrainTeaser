#Q:You are climbing a stair case. It takes n steps to reach to the top.

Each time you can either climb 1 or 2 steps. In how many distinct ways can you climb to the top?

Note: Given n will be a positive integer.

#A:
T[i] denotes number of distinct ways to climb to i-th stair
 
T[i] = T[i-1] + T[i-2]

base case T[1]=1; T[2]=2;

return T[n]
