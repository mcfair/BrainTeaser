-Q:
Find the contiguous subarray within an array (containing at least one number) which has the largest sum.

For example, given the array [-2,1,-3,4,-1,2,1,-5,4],
the contiguous subarray [4,-1,2,1] has the largest sum = 6.


-A:

T[i] denotes largest sum of continuous subarray ending at i.

T[i] = max{T[i-1]+a[i] , a[i]}

Base case T[0] = a[0]

solution is max{T[i]}
