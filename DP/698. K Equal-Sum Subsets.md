# Q:

Given an array of integers nums and a positive integer k, find whether it's possible to divide this array into k non-empty subsets whose sums are all equal.



# A:

k subset sum problem (NP-hard)

B = sum(array)/k

If we can't find a subset to sum up to B, then return False.  This step is a basic subset sum problem.

We need to remove the elements been used, and use its complementary set to rum subset_sum algorithm again, until we find (k-1) sets.
